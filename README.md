# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project. All code is thoroughly documented with comments for clarity.
- `data/`: Directory containing the heart disease dataset used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the dependencies for the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Learnings

- Explored various machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
- Achieved 88% accuracy with the chosen model.
- Visualized scores and important metrics to aid in model evaluation.
- Discovered the significance of feature importance in machine learning, emphasizing its relevance for domain specialists (e.g., doctors in this context).
- Demonstrated the use of regression models for classification, showcasing improved results.

## How to Run the Code
